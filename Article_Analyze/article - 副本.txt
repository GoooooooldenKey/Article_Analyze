During the whole of a dull,dark soundless day, in the autumn of that year
When the clouds hung oppressively low in heaven
I have benn passing alone on the horse's back
Through the Singularly, dreary tract in the country
And at length found myself as the shades of the evening drew on
Within the view of melancholy House of Usher
I know not how it was
But with the first glimpse of the building
A sense of insufferable gloom pervaded my spirit
I looked upon some blank scape for domain
Upon the bleak walls, upon the white trunks of decayed trees
With the utter depression souls
There was an iceness
A sinking
A sickening of the heart
